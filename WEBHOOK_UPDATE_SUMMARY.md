# Webhook Route Update Summary

## Changes Made

The webhook route has been updated to work properly without the `org_slug` field in the payload from the database trigger.

### Key Changes:

1. **Removed org_slug from payload type**: Updated `WebhookPayload` type to remove the optional `org_slug` field since the database function no longer provides it.

2. **Simplified organization slug extraction**: Changed from multiple fallback methods to rely primarily on the `getOrgSlugFromRecord` function.

3. **Enhanced getOrgSlugFromRecord function**: 
   - Added better error handling for database lookups
   - Added support for organizations table (uses slug field directly)
   - Added support for alternative organization ID field names
   - Improved logging for debugging

4. **Updated logging**: Removed references to `org_slug` from console logs since it's no longer in the payload.

### How it works now:

1. When a webhook is triggered, the payload contains the record data but no `org_slug`
2. The `getOrgSlugFromRecord` function looks up the organization slug by:
   - First checking if the record has an `org_slug` field directly
   - Then looking up the organization using `org_id` from the record
   - For organizations table, using the `slug` field directly
   - Trying alternative organization ID field names if needed
3. Once the organization slug is found, webhook settings are fetched and processed normally

### Database Function Recommendation:

Use `fix_function_without_slug.sql` to update your database function, which removes the `org_slug` from the payload entirely. This works perfectly with the updated webhook route.

The webhook system will now work correctly with student creation and other operations without the slug error.
