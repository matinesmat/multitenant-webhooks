# Remove Organizations from Dashboard and Sidebar

## What to do:

### 1. Run the batch file
Double-click `remove_organizations_from_dashboard.bat` to automatically remove the organizations directories from the dashboard.

### 2. Manual removal (if batch file doesn't work)
Delete these directories manually:
- `app/dashboard/organizations/` (entire directory)
- `app/[slug]/dashboard/organizations/` (entire directory)

### 3. What's already done:
✅ Removed "Organizations" from the sidebar navigation in `DashboardShell.tsx`

## What remains:
- ✅ Organizations functionality stays on the after-login page (`/select-organization`)
- ✅ Users can still create and select organizations
- ✅ Organization switching still works via the OrgSwitcher component
- ✅ Dashboard still shows organization-specific data

## Result:
- Organizations are no longer accessible from the dashboard sidebar
- Organizations are no longer accessible from dashboard pages
- Organizations remain fully functional on the after-login page
- Users can still switch between organizations using the organization switcher

The organizations functionality is now only available where it should be - on the initial organization selection page after login.
