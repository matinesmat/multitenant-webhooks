# Fix for Student Creation Error

## Problem
You're encountering two main issues:

1. **Next.js Cookies Error**: `cookies().get('sb-opahytsubdnbxpttzywm-auth-token')` should be awaited
2. **Database Error**: `record "new" has no field "slug"` when creating students

## Root Cause
The database error occurs because there are database triggers on the `students` table that are trying to access a `slug` field, but the `students` table doesn't have a `slug` field. The `slug` field exists on the `organizations` table, not the `students` table.

## Solution

### Step 1: Fix the Database Issue
Run the SQL script `apply_student_fix.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor. This script will:

1. Disable all triggers on the students table
2. Drop all problematic triggers and functions that reference 'slug'
3. Remove the webhook_outbox table that might be causing issues
4. Recreate only the necessary `update_updated_at_column` function and trigger
5. Re-enable triggers on the students table

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After running the SQL script, test student creation to ensure it works properly.

## Files Created/Modified
- `apply_student_fix.sql` - Comprehensive database fix script
- `SOLUTION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - This instruction file

## What the Fix Does
1. **Removes problematic triggers**: All triggers that try to access non-existent fields
2. **Cleans up functions**: Removes functions that reference 'slug' in the wrong context
3. **Preserves essential functionality**: Keeps only the `updated_at` trigger that's actually needed
4. **Maintains data integrity**: Ensures the students table works correctly with the existing schema

## Next Steps
1. Run `apply_student_fix.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test student creation in your application
3. Verify that both the cookies error and database error are resolved

The cookies error should already be resolved in your current code as it properly uses `await cookies()`.
